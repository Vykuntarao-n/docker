# npx Create React App Generation
In the next lecture Stephen will be going over how to install Create React App globally and generate the application. As of npm@5.2.0 we can now avoid this global install and instead use npx to generate the app on the fly to get the most current libraries and avoid many dependency conflicts. This is now the recommended way to generate an app with Create React App.

1. Instead of this:
```
npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app client
```

2. Just do this:

npx create-react-app client

Official docs on CRA usage with npx are available here:

# Basic React comnnads

  ```
  npm start
  ```
  
  Starts the development server.

  ```
  npm run build
  ```
  Bundles the app into static files for production.

  ```
  npm test
  ```
  Starts the test runner.

  ```
  npm run eject
  ```
  Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files  and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  ```
  cd client
  npm start
  ```
